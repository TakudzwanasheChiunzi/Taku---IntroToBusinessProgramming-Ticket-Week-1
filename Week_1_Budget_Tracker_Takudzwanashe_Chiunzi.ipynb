        "**1. What surprised you most about working with AI to generate code?**  \n",
        "The AI explained the code to me at every step, so it didn't feel like I was just copying and pasting, I was understanding the logiv behind the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What makes a good prompt vs. a poor prompt?**  \n",
        "Good prompts are more detailed and specific, they help the AI understand your goals more. A poor prompt laks detail and can lead to the AI having to guess or rely on implied information to get the rseult. Example: 'Please write a simple code for me' = poor vs 'Please write a simple python code to help me count up to 1000.' = Good\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. How do you see AI tools fitting into your future programming workflow?**  \n",
        "AI can be beneficial for extended learning. It can assist with explaining complex or difficult to understand coding concepts and when prompted it can make the code more clear and digestable. AI can assist me in testing my knowledge of concepts and providing clarification where I am confused.\n",
